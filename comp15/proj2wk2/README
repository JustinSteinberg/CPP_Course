This homework assignment contains some files that can be helpful towards implementing project 2

Compile/run: Compile using "make gerp", run executable with
"./gerp [path of directory] [outfile]"

Program Purpose: This project is to replicate the grep command in linux.

Files:

Main.cpp: Creates the FSTree Tree, the Traversal object, The HashMap,
and the Query.

FSTreeTraversal.cpp: Fully implemented driver. Opens a file, reads in
the words in a file and puts them into a vector to be used later

HashMap.h: Interface of HashMap class.

HashMap.cpp: Creates the Hash Table

StringProcessing.cpp: Cleans the strings 

StringProcessing.h: Interface of String Processing

FSTree.h		: interface of FSTree class  (used to explore file directories)
FSTree.o		: compiled version of FSTree.cpp
DirNode.h 		: interface of DirNode class (nodes used in FSTree)
DirNode.o 		: compiled version of DirNode.cpp
hashExample.cpp : an example on how to use the hash function (and compression) with STL library
the_gerp		: compiled solution of this assignment (good for comparing purposes)

DATA Structure:

    Used Hash Table, tried to implement linear probing to avoid
    collisions. Also utilized vectors to add values to keys that
    already existed. Hash Tables are fast to search a specific key
    using a hash function. Also utilized the HashNode which contained
    all key/value pairs and well as the line the key appears in 
    that file.

Testing: 

I went through several versions of my program. I created unit test
starting with an integer version of my hash table thanks to the
template implementation of my hash table. I then tested with small
test files and directories. 

The most difficult error I encountered was that during my string 
processing I was adding a newline to the end of the string.
So when I went to look up the index of the key, I could never find
it because all of the strings in my hash table had an extra new line
at the end. I was at office hours for a while trying to fix this.

I know I was not able to handle case sensitive/insenitive inputs due to
time contraints. :(
