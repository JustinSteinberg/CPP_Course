This homework assignment contains a partial implementation of Graph BFS traversal.


main.cpp                : main driver of the project. Creates and 'run's an instance of SixDegrees 
Graph.cpp               : graph class with extra helping tools to run DFS
Graph.h                 : interface of graph class above
LinkedList.cpp          : simple template linked list class used for DFS
LinkedList.h            : interface of Linked list class above
NodeType.h              : interface of Nodetype class (a simple struct used in the linked list class)
Stack.cpp               : simple template stack class used for DFS
Stack.h                 : interface of Stack class above
Queue.cpp               : simple template queue class used for DFS
Queue.h                 : interface of Queue class above
actors.txt              : sample list of actors and the movies they have been in
test_input.txt          : sample test input for the algorithm
the_sixdegrees          : reference implementation for students to use as reference
README                  : this file

Note: the code is not complete on purpose. Students must create several files as implement some functions in Graph
      class as well as the main driver.
