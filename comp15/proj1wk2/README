Compile/run: Compile using "make SeqMatch", run executable with
"./SeqMatch " Compile the unit tests with "make unittests" and
run executable with ./unittests

Program Purpose: This project handles creating a Trie, which is a
tree with mutiple children, using appropriate key invariance. 
We learn how to design and modularize code and work with documented libraries
as well as implement post order traversing, pre order traversing,
and recursion.


Files:
main.cpp: Main file creates the trie by passing in data from a file
and goes through testing the different functions.

Trie.cpp: Implementation of the Trie class.
Main functionality of running the Trie, should be
able to insert nodes, remove nodes, Query sequences, Prefix Query,
find the number of nodes, delete nodes, and see if
the trie contains a certain sequence.

Trie.h: Interface of Trie class.

Data Structures: Worked with Tries (reTRIEval data structure) as well as
structs & pointers. I found that logically going through the trees
on paper was really helpful for implementing my code.
The most difficult senario was trying to delete a node which
has multiple children nodes. Going through the recursion for that
case a little confusing. I was able to learn about
different types of traversals both with and without
recursion as well as depth first traversals such as
inorder, postorder, and preorder.

Testing: Here describe the following: process of testing
(unit tests), mention of bugs you encountered while testing,
mention of testing on inputs of different sizes and edge
cases, good description of base cases you considered while
testing. Demonstrate a methodical approach to testing. This
section of your REAMDE should be very thorough for homework
assignments.

For testing I created several Unit Tests with the provided
and created new "mains" as I adapted and tested each individual
function. In this homework I encountered several seg faults, mostly 
when trying to recurse through and delete nodes in the trie.
I also compared the outputs I created to the simulator
provided.
Thank you.
